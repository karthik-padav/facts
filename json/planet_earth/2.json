Fossilized sea animals are often found on
the tops of tall mountains.The mountain
tops were once parts of the seabed that
have been pushed upwards by colliding
lumps of land.
Some rocks float on water. Pumice stone is
hardened volcanic lava. It often contains so many air
bubbles that it is light enough to float.
For 186 days of the
year, the Sun is not
